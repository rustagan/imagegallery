Pet project: Gallery of random photos
# In this project I used:
1) Html
2) Css
3) JavaScript
4) Unsplash API
# What this project can do:
1) Upload random photos indicating the author of the photo
2) Ability to choose a photo from 4 uploaded thumbnails
3) A loading bar automatically starts at the top of the page, switching pictures
4) You can start and stop the loading bar
5) You can update the uploaded pictures using the "New" button and get a portion of the next random photos
